# Cloud-App-Dev-Portfolio-Project
This repo contains my API document and code for my Cloud Application Development portfolio project assignment. 

For this portfolio assignment, a marina of boats is modeled with a REST API on Google Cloud Platform using Node.js. Google Cloud Datastore is used as the database to store the entities: Users, Boats, and Loads. Each Boat in the marina is owned by a User and can carry 0 or more Loads. Users log onto the app using their Google accounts and can then manage their Boats. Users can create Boats, add Loads onto Boats, delete Boats and more. More information on the data model and endpoints is provided in the API document.
